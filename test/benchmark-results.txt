require
- First time took:  2517 ms (because of a bunch of writeByteSync probably)
- Second time took: 0 ms
- Third time took:  0 ms

constructor
- First time took:  87 ms
- Second time took: 14 ms
- Third time took:  13 ms

text()   (1024+ calls to writeByteSync)
- First time took:  524 ms
- Second time took: 379 ms
- Third time took:  401 ms

writeByteSync 1000 times
- First time took:  505 ms
- Second time took: 352 ms
- Third time took:  311 ms

So one writeByteSync takes about 0.4ms

Updating the display means writeByte is called 1024 times,
so text() should ltake about the time it takes (400ms)

Execute writeByte 10 times non-blocking but in sequence:
- 37ms (= 3.7ms per time).

========== AFTER UPDATE TO UBLOCKING ===============
Note that each operation is now unblocking,
so the time below is just how long it takes for the callback to return.
In the meantime other node stuff can execute.
